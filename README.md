# GoRouter
Golang application prototype for future split API/React frontend of a depiction of a router as an app. Educational, visual and fun! This router app will have lots of modifiable features to simulate a real router, and will make sure to display what is happening behind the scenes to all the data as frames sent to and from your router!
